If a channel stops every 20-30 seconds or skips to another channel

Each free m3u list has user limit, we always try to find the best lists with huge user limit. if more users than allowed try to watch same m3u list at the same time, channels will stop or skip to another one. In this case you can activate the “loop play button” on VLC Media Player.
