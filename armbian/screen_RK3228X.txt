Well guys I don't know if you have already done it, but 
I realized that there was no 3D acceleration on my desk 
(after installing the video drivers) so 
I modified the x11 config file and I restarted ... 
and now i have the tv box which can be used almost like a desktop ...

so Make a backup of the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/01-armbian-defaults.conf", 
and replace its content with the following:

Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Rockchip Graphics"
    Driver      "modesetting"
    Option      "AccelMethod"    "glamor"     ### "glamor" to enable 3D acceleration, "none" to disable 
    Option      "DRI"            "2"

    # You can disable Vsync for better 3D benchmark score, at the cost of worst video playing. Not recommended.
    # Option      "Dri2Vsync"      "false"

EndSection
Section "Screen"
    Identifier "Default Screen"
    SubSection "Display"
        Depth 24
        Modes "1920x1080" "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600"
    EndSubSection
EndSection
